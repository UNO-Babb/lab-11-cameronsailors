To make this shopping simulation as realistic as I could I adjusted: 

- The number of checkers
    - I changed the number of checkers to 3, which I believe to be realistic. More checkers processed customers faster and reduced the queue, adding to the realism.
    - I also increased the amount of items a checker can process in a minute to make thes simulate more realistic

- Shopper behavior
    - I changed the item numbers from 1 to 50 as I believe this to be most realistic. Sometimes I may go in to the store for one item. 
    - Shoppers with 30-50 items could decide to reduce their items in order to speed up their shopping and checkout time
    - if 30 <= items <= 50:
        items = items // 2

- Every customer shops but checkout time varies based on item count
    - I simulated self-checkout lanes for customers with very few items

- Varied customer arrival between every 1 and 3 minutes

Increasing the number of cashiers significantly reduced average wait times and total idle time. 
Large item shoppers slowed the system down, but shoppers with very few items benefited from faster checkout with self-checkout.
